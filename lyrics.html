            No
            (La-la, la-la) da-ah-ah, ah
            (Ah-ah, uh, uh, uh, yeah)

            Think I only want one number in my phone
            I might change your contact to "don't leave me alone"
            You said you like my eyes and you like to make 'em roll
            Treat me like a queen, now you got me feelin' thrown, oh

            But I can't help myself
            When you get close to me
            Baby, my tongue goes numb
            Sounds like bleh, blah, blee
            I don't want no one else (don't want)
            Baby, I'm in too deep
            Here's a lil' song I wrote (a song I wrote)
            It's about you and me (me)

            I'll be honest
            Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
            Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in
            And when you got your arms around me
            Ooh, it feels so good I had to jump the octave
            I think I got an ex but I forgot him
            And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
            I don't even know I'm talkin' nonsense
            I'm talkin', I'm talkin' (ah)

            I'm talkin' all around clock
            I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
            I'm talkin' opposite of soft
            I'm talkin' wild, wild thoughts
            You gotta keep up with me
            I got some young energy
            I caught the L-O-V-E
            How do you do this to me?

            But I can't help myself
            When you get close to me
            Baby, my tongue goes numb
            Sounds like blah, blah, bleh, blee
            I don't want no one else (don't want)
            Baby, I'm in too deep (too deep)
            Here's a lil' song I wrote (a song I wrote)
            It's about you and me

            I'll be honest (honest)
            Lookin' at you got me thinkin' nonsense
            Cartwheels in my stomach when you walk in (when you walk in)
            When you got your arms around me
            Ooh, it feels so good I had to hit the octave
            I think I got an ex but I forgot him
            And I can't find my chill, I must have lost it
            I don't even know I'm talkin' nonsense (oh)
            I'm talkin', I'm talkin', I'm talkin'

            I'm talkin', I'm talkin'
            Blah, blah, blah, blah, uh-uh-uh-uh
            Ah
            I don't even know anymore
            (Oh)

            This song catchier than chickenpox is
            I bet your house is where my other sock is
            Woke up this morning, thought I'd write a pop hit
            How quickly can you take your clothes off pop quiz?

            That one's not gonna make it
            Most of these aren't gonna make
